🏮 JadeLyre
The Sanctuary for the Wandering Bard.

JadeLyre is a labor of love created for the musicians of Where Winds Meet. It is a free, beautiful, and effortless way to bring your melodies into the world—built by a bard, for the community.

🏛️ The Vision
As a long-time bard in every world I’ve visited, I know that playing an instrument is more than just pressing keys—it’s about the atmosphere, the connection, and the journey. I built JadeLyre to move away from clunky, technical tools and offer a solution that feels as refined as the music we play.

JadeLyre is my gift to the community: a free sanctuary to help us practice, perform, and grow together.

✨ Core Features
🎹 Master the 36-Keys: Fully optimized to handle the 3-octave range of the game's instruments (Guqin, Pipa, Flute, and more) with perfect accuracy.

📜 The Chronicles: A personal diary for your music. Every performance is automatically recorded in your history, allowing you to see your progress, your total hours of play, and your daily devotion through a visual heatmap.

🎨 Dancing Ink & Silk: A "Stacked Glass" interface that feels like part of the world. Watch your music come to life with visualizers inspired by traditional ink-wash paintings.

🍃 The Breath of a Living Bard: Every note is played with human-like timing, ensuring your performance feels natural and flows with the rhythm of the land.

🏮 Born of the Troupe: A design inspired by the mystery and elegance of the Masked Troupe, featuring deep emerald, gold, and parchment aesthetics.
