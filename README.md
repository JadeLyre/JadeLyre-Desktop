JadeLyre is a labor of love created for the musicians of **Where Winds Meet**. It is a free, beautiful, and effortless way to bring your melodies into the world—built by a bard, for the community.

## 🏛️ The Vision
As a long-time bard in every world I’ve visited, I know that playing an instrument is more than just pressing keys—it’s about the atmosphere, the connection, and the journey. I built JadeLyre to move away from clunky, difficult tools and offer a solution that feels as refined as the music we play.

JadeLyre is my gift to the community: a free sanctuary to help us practice & perform together.
